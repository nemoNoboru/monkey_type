# Monkey Type!
a microgem to add a micro type system to ruby

# Why?
Adding just a bit of typing to ruby is just great. It makes you, as a programmer
have more control of what gets passed to your classes, methods or functions
and you know what your functions (and methods) returns.   
And crash earlier. ( thx "the pragmatic programmer" )   
Check out what [Matz says][matz_link]

# Why name it MonkeyType?
Well. The gem is just a [elegant][ref_link] monkeyPatch of Object and Class classes.
And it does types.   
So... MonkeyTypes!

# Installation
```
gem install monkey_type
```

# Usage
well. I tried to simplify the usage as hard as i can.   
There is just two new things
to learn. the method *#is* and the class macro *contract*.   
the method is used like this:   
(remember to you need both 'require' and 'using' lines!)

```ruby
require 'monkey_type'
using MonkeyType

def accepts_only_nums(num)
  num.is Numeric
  #things here
end
```


the method *#is* will raise an exception in the form of:
```
error: String is not an Numeric (TypeError)
```
if `accepts_only_nums` is called and num isn't numeric or something like numeric.
Remember, we are duck typing here.
Simple isn't it?


```ruby
require 'monkey_type'
using MonkeyType

class Returner
  def return1
    1
  end

  def return2
    []
  end

  contract :return1, Numeric
  contract :return2, Array
end  
```

Remember to call *contract* **after** defining the methods.   
calling this contract will invoke metaprogramming deities and will ensure that the
method will return something like a Numeric in case of return1 and a Array in case of return2.
Also, you can call the functions on a typeless manner, just add **"\_typeless"** to the
end of the name of the method (like *return1_typeless*).


I have also included some types for your commodity.
if you want to check if something is a Numeric or nil use *option(Numeric)*
(you can change Numeric for Hash or even for you own class names)
if you want to check if something is true or false use *boolean*

```ruby
def i_accept_nil_or_array(t)
  t.is option(Array)
end

class Booled
  def i_return_true_or_false
    #boolean logic
  end

  contract :i_return_true_or_false, boolean
end
```
that is all.

# Running in irb

The interactive ruby interpreter `irb` is unable to handle `using` modules in the method
required by monkey_type.  This is a known limitation.  See [Stack Overflow][irb_so] for more details.

# Contributing
If you want to help focus on the method is_duck? and how to make easier to add
new "types" as Boolean or Option.
Or, make better error messages.
